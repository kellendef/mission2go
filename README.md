# mission2go
A basic mission project materials and personnel logging system. 

Please note that this is far from an optimal piece of software as-is. As I've continued to
learn Express and Node after graduation (this project was my introduction to them), I am
now aware of several bad practices present in the source code. I could go back and re-
create this without the global variables, and use packages that allow more secure 
authentication. However, this project was largely a learning experience for me, as this
was also my introduction to JavaScript. However, I feel it more important to continue
learning and moving on to other frameworks more robust than pugjs, such as React and Svelte, 
and learn security best practices more fully with these.

The Zipped folder in this repository contains the complete code for the application.
The general overall code for the application is in this repository, including the 
views folder, server.js file which runs an web server and api, and a sql file that will 
generate the necessary tables and schema in Microsoft SQL
